## Welcome to Project Devrantia

> This whole thing is originated at [devRant Collab](https://devrant.com/collabs/1063123/rpg-for-developers-devlife). First I thought of going with devlife but decided to steal "devrantia" from our discord server. (Don't kill me guys). All credits go to so many developers I have met on devrant. Without meeting them, without using devrant, this project would have never started.

The purpose of this page is to update you guys with the progress of Devrantia. _(It will be slow but I do plan to finish it.)_
